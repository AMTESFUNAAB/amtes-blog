What happens when you research a bunch of companies, apply to them, only to get back that dreaded reply? Spoiler alert: itâ€™s a rollercoaster ride! ðŸŽ¢

Well, an awful lot like pain... but it doesn't have to be!

Hello, and welcome to the Careers & Alumni department! It's your favorite postgrad, the one and only, your host: Ruby! ðŸ’ƒâœ¨

I'm here to guide you through the exhilarating process of researching companies and applying to them. Together, we'll navigate the ups and downs, and hopefully, Iâ€™ll be there to hand you tissues when you get rejected (I know, I know, thank me later). But fear not! Each rejection is just a stepping stone to your dream job! ðŸš€
