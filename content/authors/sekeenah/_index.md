Hola! My name is Sekeenah. I am from Abeokuta. It's literally where I have lived all my life. To quote a friend of mine " Do you want to spend your entire life here?" Nope.

I'm a bit of an impulsive decision-maker, which is probably how I ended up studying Mechatronics Engineering. No inspiring backstory or grand plan, just a spontaneous choice. I am currently in my fourth year and still has a lot of figuring out to do.

## What I like

- Reading: Got a good read? Hit me up! I prefer fictional but wouldn't mind a non fictional. ( Even if I am just going to add them to my unending TBR)
- Cats: Super cute animals.
- Sleep: I need it.
- Food: Duh!

You will know the rest over time.

## Anything Left?

I forgot something. What you should expect. That's literally everything and anything. I am going to be all over the map. But you will learn a thing or two from every post. A post once a week (hopefully) or in two weeks. Think of it as a weekly or bi-weekly peek into my mind.

P.S If you haven't watched the tv show called Friends, it's a crime ( I couldn't stop myself).
