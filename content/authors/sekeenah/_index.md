Hola! My name is Sekeenah. I am from Abeokuta. It's literally where I have lived all my life. To quote a friend of mine " Do you want to spend your entire life here?" Nope.

Sorry. I don't how to do this. 
Let's start over. My name is Sekeenah. Wondering what that means? Tranquility. But to be more precise "Peace of the mind." I like that better. 

I am in my finals. If you ask me what happened through my time here, I did look at you like I have a broken brain. I write—but that's obvious, I guess.

Well... 
When I'm not dealing with student life (chaos of finals), I am reading a good book. I'm a fiction lover, currently deep into the Asylum Confession series by Jack Steen. I can make room on my unending TBR for a compelling non-fiction title too. Beyond books, I seek the absolute necessity of sleep, and of course, food. Duh!

I have said all but nothing about what my interest as a Mechatronics Engineer is. It’s hard to pin down just one thing because I like the blend of the disciplines. You know, creating an intelligent system from a seamless integration.

Have I done justice to this introduction? Not sure, you are the judge. Give me a 10 while you are at it.

P.S If you haven't watched the tv show called Friends, it's a crime ( I couldn't stop myself).
