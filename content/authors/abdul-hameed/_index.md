Wait, is this thing on? HellooO HuManS! Can you hear me? Oh, you can!

Well then, allow me to introduce myself: I'm Abdul-Hameed, a '25, ~~future robot therapist~~, sleep-deprived technical writer, researcher, professional productivity consultant, and aspiring polyglot.

Okay, why should you spend the next few minutes reading what I have to say? Well:

- I can cook (just don't ask my roommate, he's still recovering from my last experiments).
- I've mastered the art of overclocking my brain at 20 ideas per hour; pretty cool right, I know!
- I *know* you're avoiding that laundry pile or that essay due tomorrow. Fret not, I'm right there with you, shading responsibilities like a pro!
- I've carried out extensive experiments on the relationship between `Due: 11:59 PM` and mental breakdownsâ€”results are inconclusive, but I'm pretty sure they're correlated.

Good enough?
