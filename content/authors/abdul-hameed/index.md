Hello humans! Hold up, Is this thing on? HeLlOo HuManS! Can you hear me? Oh, you can! Well then, allow me to introduce myself: I'm Abdul-Hameed, a '25, future robot therapist ....

Pause. By the way, if you’re expecting a typical introduction, you might want to adjust your expectations—this is going to be anything but ordinary! Now, where was I:

...sleep-deprived technical writer, citation-starving researcher (listen, is it really plagiarism if I cite myself? think about it), professional productivity consultant, and aspiring polyglot (I can speak 5 different languages until my brain decides to go *...please wait...* in conversations with natives).

So, why should you spend the next few minutes reading what I have to say? Well:

- I can cook (just don't ask my roommate, he's still recovering from my last experiments)
- I've mastered the art of overclocking my brain at 20 ideas per hour; pretty cool right, I know!
- I know you're avoiding that pile of laundry or that essay due tomorrow. Fret not, I'm right there with you, shading responsibilities like a pro!
- I've carried out extensive experiments on the relationship between `Due: 11:59 PM` assignments and mental breakdowns—results are inconclusive, but I'm pretty sure they're correlated.
- I once attended a networking event (Narrator: He most certainly did not). Apparently a lot of people aren't interested in discussing the philosophical implications of why cats look you dead in the eye and knock things off the table. Who knew?
- Once upon a time, I had a well-planned calendar—until weekly manual submissions happened and my life turned into a skit.

Good enough? "Cut! Okay wrap it up guys, I'll see you in 10. Make new friends, or enemies, your choice. Hey You! Yes, You! Don't. click. the button. below."
