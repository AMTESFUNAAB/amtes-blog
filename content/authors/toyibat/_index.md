Hey there! I’m Toyibat (that’s ‘toh-yye-bah’). and I’m obsessed with Pepsi and cats. That’s one of the first things you’ll easily find out about me.

Right after, you’ll also find out how obsessed I am with technology! I’ve always been a hands-on person and fascinated with the idea of bringing my ideas to life. That led me to pursue a career in engineering and now I’m in my fourth year as a mechatronics engineering student in FUNAAB. I’m also involved in the software side as a machine learning engineer.

Besides academics, I love to read fiction books (shoot me any good book you’ve read, please!) and I watch movies-sparingly. I also love to try new things so if there’s any cool idea you have in mind, let me know!

I hope to share my experiences as a student of FUNAAB, a woman in engineering, and a woman in tech. If that sounds like your kind of adventure (or not), I’d be thrilled to have you along. And feel free to reach out anytime—I love meeting new people!
