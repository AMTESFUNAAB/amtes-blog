I always thought I'd become a doctor growing up. Somewhere along the line, I realised I was more interested in creating stuff and solving problems differently. Then, I fell in love with physics, and my dream of becoming a doctor said, "Bye-bye." Add those up, and now I'm in my third year pursuing a mechatronics engineering career.

On my journey, I learned about data science. "A field that involves machine learning and AI? "Sign me up!" Getting into the field puts me in a better position to solve problems. It's also harmonious with my degree of choice, so it was a no-brainer. Now I juggle writing lines of code and solving calculus â€” while writing about my experiences as a technical writer!
