What to write

                what do I have to say?

What to write

          but I have so much to say.

What to write

                        would you stay if I say:

It's not complicated.

        You don't have to think too hard about it.

It's not complicated.

                                  Sometimes we think too hard about it.

And maybe sometimes it *is* complicated

You at an instant feel the vibrance, you sense the ambiance, you feel the words as though you're a part of that world. It's quite amazing really.

**So what does it mean to be a blogger?**

A blog post is a snapshot of life at that moment. It's a preservation of my thought process and worldview at a point in time. It is, to me, an attempt to share my inner world.

It really isn't that hard and I'm starting to understand, primarily due to reading other [bloggers](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/), that it's okay to not have it all figured out. it's okay to not dot your i's. it's okay to not be perfect.

Those who appreciate your writing would read what adventures you have to share.

Those who enjoy your writing are excited when you have something to share.
