What to write; what to say?

What to write; what do I have to say?

What to write, but I have so much to say.

What to write, would you stay if I say:

It's not complicated. You don't have to think too hard about it.

It's not complicated. Sometimes we think too hard about it.

And maybe sometimes it *is* complicated, but we think too hard about it.

See, I've always loved writing. I love sharing ideas. I love thinking about ideas. Some of my cherished moments are when I step outside my head into someone else's world built through their words.

I read somewhere, "reading is like opening a window into the life of the other." You, at an instant, feel the vibrance, you sense the ambiance, you feel the words as though you're a part of that world. It's quite amazing really.

**So what does it mean to be a blogger?**

I see blogging as what I described earlier: a window into the life of the other. A blog post is a snapshot of life at that moment. It's a preservation of my thought process and worldview at a point in time. It is, to me, an attempt to share the beauty of certain experiences and express the hurt of others.

It's an attempt to share my inner world.

It really isn't that hard and I'm starting to understand, primarily due to reading other [bloggers](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/), that it's okay to not have it all figured out. it's okay to not dot your i's. it's okay to not be perfect.

Those who appreciate your writing would read what adventures you have to share.

Those who enjoy your writing are excited when you have something to share.
