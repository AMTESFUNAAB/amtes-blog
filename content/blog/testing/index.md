This is some content inside this page. I want to learn to write and not stop writing. But writing is hard for me because I can't really think of

{{< blockquote 
  quote="How much do you want to know about the working conditions at every stage of the supply chain? How much are you morally obligated to know, with what consequences? Few of us would likely condone every moment of every supply chain for every product we consume. Yet to fully ethically withdraw from that participation would involve a renunciation of modern life."

And this is some random stuff after this image. What I'm trying to do is to get a full sized image to show at any point in the post.

So adding

```
{{</* fullwidth src="image.jpg" alt="A Nice Beetle Car" */>}}
```

Should at the end of this, Bi idnillah show:

Yeah, nope. It doesn't work!

BUT!

I think we should be able to do pull quotes now! :star:

{{< pullquote >}}
Hello World. This is some content in here!  

Or maybe it needs to be like a really long quote so that the thingies can then show up or something.  

“In an alternative grading system, grades are directly tied to what stu­dents actually learn, and reassessments make those grades more accurate. So when you see higher grades, it means more learning. That’s not “inflation”; it’s real growth.” (p. 59)
{{< /pullquote >}}

Eh?

It doesn't show properly ooo!  
this is something

You can keep writing
