_Festivities_. Sounds like a nice word for what's going on in FUNAAB at the moment. Activities during a yearly festival such that the activities are packed with tests. Exams in toll.  Chaos.

Tests before bells, exams after cheers.
_Jingle bell, jingle bell. Tests on the way. 
Exams right after the big celebration. A jingle tingle_

Calendar mocking us year in, year out. Test always lining up just before Christmas, exam waiting after the merry jingle, just after rice and chicken has been enjoyed. 

Santa? Who still believes that? Here I am, making wishes. Not for gifts, nor for cash. No sleigh, no reindeer, no cheer. Just... to pass.

Torque and calculations running. Between Kirchoffs laws and thermodynamics design calculations. Carol humming behind. Sounds like background noise.

Lights... Of colours light around me shine. Reds, yellow but can I see white? Can it all be clear. Dangers all around me, enjoyment in between.

Well... Shouldn't I still ball in this festive period? Just thinking... Realisation transforming hit me when I saw x-transforms and euphoria from fourier transforms. Una suppose dey excited too. Xmas.

Then this thought hits me:
_A system without preparation will oscillate after examination. Enjoy the moment, but don't lose the plot._
