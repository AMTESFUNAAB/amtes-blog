Just thinking about the life of the engineers(seniors) we all admire in MTE. Oh the thrills. We are all humans after all. Even great engineers have a life. Walk with me.

How cool or how not cool is a mechatronics engineer. Final projects from them are always very cool.
Laugh or cry with me as we look into this. In this series, we'll be looking through the life of a mechatronics engineering student.
