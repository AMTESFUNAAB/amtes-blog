*Welcome to the first instalment of our new series,* "Why Mechatronics?"

*We will be getting a glimpse into the personal journey of various student in the department that led them to choose Mechatronics Engineering and their perspectives as they navigate their academic path.*

*Get ready to be inspired by their stories and gain a deeper understanding of what draws students to the fascinating world of mechatronics. Let‚Äôs dive in.*

## Toyibat ‚Äò26

*In the interview with Toyibat, we learnt how she got her interest in robotics due to her lack of interest in writing an external exam. This eventually led to her finding out about Mechatronics engineering totally different from the initially medical field plan.*

**Sekeenah:**  How did you learn about mechatronics engineering?

**Toyibat:** I learned about Mechatronics because I didn't want to write GCE. I was in SS2 and I had just written mock exams. I travelled down to Abuja to spend time with my dad, but I was set to leave in a few days to write my GCE. My parents suggested this so I'd know what to expect from WAEC and all.

One morning, my parents and I were gathered in the living room listening to the 'Brekete' show on Human Rights Radio. Someone was talking about a robotics boot camp. My dad asked if I'd be interested, and I genuinely was cause I had always been technology inclined from a young age. The date of the boot camp was during when I'd have started my GCE, but my dad thought the experience would be worth it. I also wasn't ready to write it cause I had not been reading a lot, so that gave me the final nudge to apply for the boot camp and devote my time to something worthwhile.

I loved every second of it. I came out of the boot camp wanting to study Robotics engineering but after a quick search, I found that Mechatronics was what was available in Nigeria, and it encompassed Robotics. That was what led me to find out about this course.

**Sekeenah:** Studying engineering after missing an exam? Now that‚Äôs one funny story. Why did you decide to go for it as your course of study?

**Toyibat:** Before deciding to study engineering, in fact, I was working towards studying Medicine.

I didn't necessarily have the passion for it, but it felt like the best thing to aim at as I was still figuring things out. I loved Physics more than Biology, though, so I was starting to consider studying Physics.

The boot camp made me realize I could do engineering, and I switched paths to that. My mum really wanted me to do Medicine, so I was considering Biomedical engineering at first to combine both of our interests, but I wasn't feeling it. I chose Mechatronics because it was the best way to build on my interest in Physics and robotics.

I also chose Mechatronics because it's broad. I could easily choose to specialize in any engineering field I found interesting after my BEng.  

**Sekeenah:**  What's your take about it so far, and what are you looking forward to?

**Toyibat:** I love it, and I would choose Mechatronics over and over again. I'm actually really looking forward to possibly getting into grad school for Robotics or Aerospace. I really want to be an expert in either of these fields and keep on doing what makes me happy.

**Sekeenah:** Nice to see you are enjoying your choice. Any additional information you are willing to add?

**Toyibat:** If you're considering studying Engineering or specifically, Mechatronics. Do it!

## Daniel ‚Äò28

*We learnt that Daniel is an engineer at the core. He has been inclined to solving problems from time, and he is probably one of the few people to have an elder sibling to look up to in this field.*

**Sekeenah:** How did you learn about Mechatronics Engineering?

**Daniel:** The first time I heard about the course was from my brother (who's currently studying it), but at that time, I hadn't decided which engineering course to pick, let alone Mechatronics.

**Sekeenah:** Oh, you have a brother in school? That's nice. Which level is he?

**Daniel:** 500 Level

**Sekeenah:** Okay. Why did you decide to go for it as your course of study?

**Daniel:** Right from junior secondary school, I have always been fascinated by drones, robots, autonomous vehicles, aircraft, etc.

Did I mention drones? I had about four failed attempts at building a drone back then, but my limited knowledge didn't take into account factors like weight, battery power, efficiency, and the types of DC motors. However, I successfully built ground vehicles, a robotic arm (hydraulics, not with servos), a cooling fan for myself when the heat was unbearable‚Ä¶,and many other projects.

So, I already had this flair for robotics and automation, and the traditional engineering courses like CVE, MCE, and ELE were just too boring for me to consider. Since Robotics is not offered as a standalone course in Nigeria, Mechatronics was the next best option.

**Sekeenah:** Okay, wow. You have 4 failed drone attempts?!

I think it‚Äôs safe to say you have more hands-on experience than most people. This is really impressive. You are an engineer at the core. And I love that you have enough to show for it. Really glad to have people like you in the department.

What helped you to try all this yourself, a boot camp or just the plain interest in it?

**Daniel:** Plain interest and a lot of YouTube.

**Sekeenah:** What is your take on it so far, and what are you looking forward to?

**Daniel:** I feel that some of the courses we're taking aren't necessary as prerequisites for core Mechatronics topics, and I think we should have more MTE courses, especially in 200 and 300 Level.

Nevertheless, I look forward to taking MTE courses from 300 level and above, going on SIWES 1 and 2, working on numerous projects, and developing Mechatronics engineering solutions for real-life problems.

**Sekeenah:** Hmmm. Ain't necessary?

**Daniel:** Well, if it‚Äôs from the view of it not being what we expect when picking the course, then I agree. The courses might not be necessary, but helpful, nevertheless.

**Sekeenah:** And I am with you, having more mechatronics courses, maybe not in 200 level, but in 300. You are in 200L already. Do you already have a place in mind for your SIWES, cause I believe it‚Äôs never too early to sort out places, and given your already beyond beginner hands-on experience.

**Daniel:** Sure, I am looking into this robotics company, Terraphaptics, but I am considering other places in case I don‚Äôt get in.

**Sekeenah:** I am really impressed by your replies. People like you are the reason we are bringing forth this series. To get to know the amazing people in the department and why they are here.

**Daniel:** Thank you for the opportunity.

**Sekeenah:** You are welcome, and it was nice talking to you.

## Olajire ‚Äò28

*In the interview with Olajire, we got to know of her childhood interest in Robotics that came from watching cartoons that broadened her mind. We also got to see how Mechatronics showed up on her feed in her search for robotics school in the country.*

**Sekeenah:** How did you learn about Mechatronics Engineering?

**Olajire:** I learnt about mechatronics when I was looking for universities that were offering robotics in Nigeria. The course popped up on my search feed, so I researched it, and here we are.

**Sekeenah:** Looking into robotics? So, you‚Äôve been interested in that for how long? What sparked the interest?

**Olajire:** I‚Äôve had an interest since I was in primary school.

I watched a lot of cartoons like My Life as a Teenage Robot and Jimmy Neutron, among others. I was fascinated with how you could make something that interacts as well as they did in cartoons, and what the process of making them would be like.

**Sekeenah:** That‚Äôs amazing. We could say you are following your passion. Why did you decide to go for it as your course of study?

**Olajire:** I decided to go for it after I researched, and it felt like what I wanted to do, and I thought it would be something fun.

**Sekeenah:** How has the experience been so far?

**Olajire:** It has been okay, but I expected a more hands-on experience; but since we are in Nigeria, we take what we get. Seeing some higher-level projects has given me a lot to look forward to, knowing that with a lot of personal practice, I will be able to do things like that someday.

**Sekeenah:** Expecting more is a normal thing most of us here are experiencing. But like you said, it‚Äôs Nigeria. Anything you are studying will require more personal practice for expertise.

**Olajire:** Thank you for the interview.

**Sekeenah:** You're welcome. I hope your experience over time is somewhat what you expect.

## Hafsoh ‚Äò29

*We learnt how Hafsoh‚Äôs interest moved from Aeronautics Engineering to Mechatronics Engineering. She made it known that she was never the girl who had a thing for medicine from the start.*

**Sekeenah:** How did you learn about Mechatronics Engineering?

**Hafsoh:** During my one-year gap after secondary school, I explored different engineering fields and discovered Mechatronics Engineering. Initially, I aspired to study Aeronautics Engineering, but this period helped me refine my passion.

I realized that I wanted to pursue engineering not just for the title but to solve real world  problems, particularly in Nigeria. One major issue I identified was the challenges in agriculture, labor inefficiency and the need for healthier farm products. So after the research I think choosing mechatronics engineering is the best option.

**Sekeenah:** Wow. This is very nice and interesting. So, you've always had a passion for engineering itself. Did you realise this over time, or someone is behind it like a person you look up to or so

**Hafsoh:** No, I realized it myself. I've always been a lover of mathematics and physical science. Although I've always been convinced to study medicine, I discovered I did not have any interest in it.

**Sekeenah:** Amazing then. I think everybody had that once upon a time interest in medicine.

**Hafsoh:** Not me, I never had an interest in it. I could recall when I was in my basic classes my mom once asked me if I would like to become a medical doctor and I gave her a straight response of NO. Although I had no idea of becoming an engineer.

**Sekeenah:** What's your view so far and what are you looking forward to?

**Hafsoh:** Engineering is really promising, but I‚Äôve realized that the higher you go, the tougher it gets. It demands a lot of dedication, hard work, and persistence to succeed.

Despite the challenges, I find it exciting because it keeps pushing me to learn and improve. I‚Äôm also looking forward to diving deeper into my departmental courses and exploring more about Mechatronics Engineering.

**Sekeenah:** I like the spirit. You seem ready to take on any challenge on your path. Mechatronics Engineering is a course with sub courses ( if get what I  mean).

Remember to have fun also. The time goes by before you know it. Thank you for your time.
